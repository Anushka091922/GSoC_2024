# GSoC_2024
This repository is for GSoC tasks 
Here is the link for the DOc that I have created for the Submission
[(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dF5EIExekmSqEW_EHCeUIOb3e9xGPlSU-HmnWUksWNA/edit?usp=sharing)]

## Directions to use and run the files:
1) firstly build root by taking reference from ([https://root.cern.ch/building-root)]
2) then directly copy-paste the files and run them.
3) For the Example code to run the name of the dataset file is 'dataset.txt' and we have to include that file file first into the same directory as the Python file.
